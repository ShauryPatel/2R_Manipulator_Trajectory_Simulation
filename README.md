# 2R_Manipulator_Trajectory_Simulation

#Overview
This project involves the development and simulation of three distinct trajectories for a 2R robotic manipulator using Python. The project showcases precise control over the joint angles and end-effector positioning of the manipulator. It includes the implementation of forward and inverse kinematics algorithms, enabling accurate calculation and visualization of the manipulator's movement along predefined paths.
#Features 
*Trajectory Simulation: Three distinct trajectories developed for the 2R robotic manipulator.
*Kinematics Algorithms: Forward and inverse kinematics implemented for accurate control of the manipulator.
*Visualization: Real-time visualization of the manipulator's movement along each trajectory.
